# TeamGibberfish_CSCI3308_FA16
## Term Project for CSCI 3308 University of Colorado Boulder.
###Project Milestone 1:

####Team Name: 
Gibberfish 

####Members: 
Eric Murphy, Matt Moore, Joshua McCann, Adrian Paz, Chuan ‘Nelson’ Khor, Maria Knigge

####Description:
Our goal is to centralize and consolidate fishing information, thereby increasing information accessibility and angler satisfaction. With an interactive web page, users will be able to create profiles for themselves and record information about fish caught at specific locations, discover new fishing spots and search for rivers, streams and lakes containing specific varieties of fish.

Avid anglers and fishing enthusiasts may build profiles to catalog their fishing exploits; they may create records of the types and sizes of fish they catch at specific locations. Additionally, users may search for nearby bodies of water by inputting geographical information (i.e. city, state and/or zip code) and our system will provide detailed descriptions of local streams, rivers and lakes, including name, a list of the fish inhabiting these bodies, fishing restrictions and/or special regulations and a link to the state’s fishing regulations for the year. For anglers who seek to catch a specific variety of fish, we will implement a search that allows users to input a fish variety (either the English or Latin name) and returns bodies of water containing this fish, along with fishing restrictions and regulations for the area.

####Vision Statement:
Your number one fishing companion that provides a wealth of fishing resources, species guide, easy-to-use state and federal regulations to our fellow anglers, ichthyologists, and fish enthusiasts. 

####Motivation: 
This application will be able to locate where specific fish are and also be able to tell you what fish are in specific lakes and rivers. It’s easy to find what fish are in a state or county, but it is hard to find where specifically in what body of water you are likely to find them in. The motivation behind this app is to make something that will aid anglers to find the fish they want and where it is as soon and as easy as possible.

####Risks: 
There are several areas within this project where risks are involved--overarching risks, like those revolving around scheduling, are the most prominent in our minds. Our schedules are extremely varied, having changed since the initial CATME survey; finding a time to meet that works for everyone, week after week, may prove difficult. These time constraints are further exacerbated by the length of the semester; there are twelve weeks before the end of our semester and we are only available a limited amount of hours per weeks. There is also concern about our computational experience--only two of six group members have substantial experience in building web apps. Pertaining to the app itself, we are concerned about finding adequate and accurate information on Boulder-specific fishing locations, as well as not being able to complete all facets of the features. Our team’s experience in fishing is also a potential problem, as only half of the team actively fishes and can provide accurate feedback at this time.

####Risk Mitigation Plan:
Keeping all of these risks in mind, we have developed a plan to mitigate them as much as possible. For scheduling, we will have meetings only once a week and use Slack for more immediate contact concerns, with Google Hangouts waiting in the wings should a member not be able to make our weekly meeting. A large amount of resources exists to help teach and understand web apps, and we can use that knowledge and tools to supplement our gaps in that technology. The scope of the project will increase as time goes on, beginning with a database of fish and where to find them in the local area. We will expand with more locations and user profiles once the foundation of the app is built. The Boulder city and county locations should be able to obtained from the local wildlife department. While our team is somewhat inexperienced when it comes to actual fishing, we are all enthusiastic about the project and excited to begin working on it!

####Version Control: 
For this project we will be using GitHub as the repository and version control system. Our repository is contained here: https://github.com/Mamo8125/TeamGibberfish_CSCI3308_FA16

####Software Development Methodology: 
We intend to use the Agile software development methodology. Every step in this software development methodology is divided into small pieces, and each piece is worked on in rapid cycles until it is completed. Each completed piece should build on, and improve the functionality of the previous one until the project is completed. Each part of the project meets weekly in its teams to determine goals, review progress, break project into parts for every team member, discuss potential improvements and adjustments and set a timeframe for everyone to complete their parts.

We will be using Agile software development methodology because the product has room for potential growth depending on how much time it takes us to complete the main part of the project, as well as the increased collaboration aspect between team members.

We intend to meet one time weekly, but will hold meetings as needed in order to complete each phase of the project. We will also use slack as our primary method of collaborating, sharing feedback and providing help to our team outside these meetings throughout the week and to keep each other updated. 

####Collaboration Tool: 
Slack, Google Docs, Google Hangouts
