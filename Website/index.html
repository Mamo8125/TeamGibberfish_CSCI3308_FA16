<p>
Colorado has two special designations for fishing. Most of the state follows the aforementioned regulations but Gold Medal and Wild Trout waters offer a different type of experience. Catching fish in these waters requires greater knowledge of angling and usually the fish must be returned to their habitat.
<br>
<br>
Gold Medal Waters
Gold Medal Waters provide areas to catch larger trout for an enhanced fishing experience. Designated areas may have different regulations, please refer to local guidelines for detailed information.
<br>

		<br><br>
Wild Trout Waters
Wild Trout Waters provide anglers the opportunity to catch trout in a natural environment. The fish population must sustain itself through natural reproduction and recruitment. Designated areas are limited and regulations vary, please refer to local guidelines for detailed information.
<br>
<br>
Types of Trout in Colorado:
Brown Trout: The spotting pattern is composed of black spots and also red orange spots surrounded by light blue.
<br>
<br>
Brown Trout
Lake Trout (Mackinaw): The fish has a white, irregular spotting pattern on a dark background with veriform marking over the back and head. Unlike other trout, they have a deeply indented tail fin.
<br>
<br>
Lake Trout
Cutthroat Trout (Native): Cutthroat have a crimson slash on either side of the throat beneath the lower jaws.
<br>
<br>
Cutthroat Trout
Brook Trout: The pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are often orange, edged with black & white. The body is dark with read spots and surrounded by blue and white spots.
<br>
<br>
Brook Trout
Rainbow Trout: Identifying Marks are the black spots on a light body and a red stripe along the sides of a fish.
<br>
<br>
Rainbow Trout
Kokanee Salmon: At the end of their third summer, females develop a red/grey/white pattern while males develop hook jaw and turn brick red.

		<h1>Latest Headline #1</h1>
		<p>Boulder/Metro – High flows on most metro rivers has kept interest low for both winter steelhead and Willamette River sturgeon. Besides less than ideal river conditions, anchored anglers on the Willamette need to be cautious about floating and submersed trees that can get entangled in anchor lines and cause a dangerous boating situation. It’s best to wait until flows subside.
		
<img src="http://portlandtribune.com/images/artimg/00003563442555.jpg" align="right" height="400" width="300" hspace="50" vspace="50"/> 
<br>With dropping snow levels, Sandy River anglers should start to see improved water conditions by the weekend. Catches of steelhead will likely remain slow until mid-December however.<br>Clackamas River steelheaders will also have to wait another few weeks before better opportunities arise, but the smaller Eagle Creek tributary fishery will clear faster, although steelhead don’t tend to enter this river in good number for another week or so. Small egg clusters often work best for early season anglers.<br><br>The Tillamook Report – Coastal steelheaders were largely sidelined for much of the holiday weekend as torrential downpours kept rivers muddy and fish subdued. 12- year old Jackson Curran of Portland gets credit for the first confirmed take of a winter steelhead on the North Fork Nehalem River. Jackson was fishing with his dad Paul, who also hooked and lost a steelhead and landed a quality late-season Chinook. The hatchery reach, about 11 miles out of the town of Nehalem, is the most productive when flows are high. This area will be very popular for the next 5 weeks.<br>When flows subside, the Kilchis and Wilson Rivers will also harbor late season Chinook as well as winter steelhead. Both rivers should fish by the weekend but realize we’re in the shoulder season for both species. Regardless, 2-fish limits are possible, just not likely.
<br>Further south, Three Rivers near Hebo should start to witness more consistent steelhead fishing. This smaller tributary to the Nestucca clears fast and has some good public access points for bank anglers. Small egg clusters and sand shrimp should produce results for persistent anglers. Like the North Fork Nehalem, this run will remain productive into the first week of January.
<br>Historically, Tillamook Bay itself has produced good Chinook catches into mid-December. With a slower than normal late season however, this won’t be the year to fish with confidence here. Regardless, the Ghost Hole and Bay City slots may produce a few late season Chinook, but effort is down.
<br>Coastal estuaries south of Tillamook Head near Seaside remain closed to Dungeness crabbing.
<br>Northwest Oregon – Located along Highway 30 east of Astoria, Big Creek and Gnat Creek offer up some great small stream steelheading opportunities. Although both have tracts of private land that doesn’t allow trespassing, public access is available if you look for it. Most anglers expend their time close to the hatcheries that produced these fish. Returning adults congregate in good numbers at these locations.
<br>The Klaskanine River is another north coast early season favorite that begins to produce this time of year. The Necanicum is also known for early season success with good bank access.<br><br>Lower Columbia River crabbing remains productive, especially with the delay in the commercial crab opener, which typically takes place on December 1st.<br>For a more detailed report, go to www.TheGuidesForecast.com<br><br>Bob Rees is a sixth generation Oregonian and a 20-year veteran fishing guide of Oregon's Northwest region. Bob Rees' column, The Guide's Forecast, has been a trusted fishing resource for over 16 years and will appear in the Thursday edition of the Portland Tribune.
